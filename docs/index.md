# Tensorflow ML

TensorFlow ML is a project that aims to provide an abstract implementation of commonly used machine learning algorithms using TensorFlow, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn. This project is designed to offer a comprehensive and flexible set of machine learning models that can be used for various tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering, and more.

## Getting started

You can install TensorFlow ML from PyPI using `pip`. Follow these steps:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-ml
```

Alternatively, to use TensorFlow ML from GitHub directly, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/siddhantpathakk/tensorflow-ml.git`
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After the installation is complete, you can import the implemented machine learning models in your Python scripts and start using TensorFlow ML for your machine learning tasks.

## Participate in Contributing

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance the TensorFlow ML library. If you are interested in contributing, follow these steps:

1. Fork the project on GitHub: [https://github.com/siddhantpathakk/tensorflow-ml](https://github.com/your_username/tensorflow-ml)
2. Create a new branch for your feature/bugfix: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Implement your changes and improvements.
4. Write tests to ensure the functionality of the added models.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. Create a pull request to the main repository, describing your changes in detail.

Your contributions will be reviewed, and once approved, they will be merged into the main project. Let's work together to make TensorFlow ML a powerful and versatile machine learning library!
